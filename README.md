# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Boston’s suburbs. Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located at the Boston’s area. A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided in a dayly basis.
